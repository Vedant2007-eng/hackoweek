        <h2>Trip 1: Adventure in the Mountains</h2>
        <div class="info">📍 Location: Himalayan Region | 📅 Duration: 5 Days</div>
        <p>
            This mountain trip was an unforgettable adventure filled with scenic valleys,
            snowy peaks, and peaceful surroundings. Every morning began with fresh air
            and stunning sunrise views.
        </p>
        <p>
            The highlight of this journey was trekking through narrow trails and staying
            in small mountain villages. The locals were friendly and shared beautiful
            stories about their culture and lifestyle.
        </p>
        <p>
            Personally, this trip taught me patience, physical endurance, and a deep
            appreciation for nature.

        <h2>Trip 2: Relaxing at the Beach</h2>
        <div class="info">📍 Location: Goa | 📅 Duration: 4 Days</div>
        <p>
            This beach vacation was all about relaxation and peace. The sound of waves,
            warm sand, and cool breeze made every moment enjoyable.
        </p>
        <p>
            I spent my days walking along the shoreline, enjoying local seafood,
            and watching beautiful sunsets. The nightlife near the beach was lively
            and full of energy.
        </p>
        <p>
            This trip helped me slow down, refresh my mind, and return with positive energy.

        <h2>Trip 3: Exploring a New City</h2>
        <div class="info">📍 Location: Mumbai | 📅 Duration: 3 Days</div>
        <p>
            Exploring a new city was exciting and educational. The city was full of life,
            with busy streets, tall buildings, and historical monuments.
        </p>
        <p>
            I visited famous landmarks, museums, local markets, and street food stalls.
            Every place had a unique story to tell and reflected the city’s culture.
        </p>
        <p>
            This trip improved my understanding of urban life and helped me connect
            with people from different backgrounds.
